# B9: Image Compare(Level 2) 
You need to use the provided index.html, style.css (empty file), two images (before.jpg and after.jpg) and a 
splitter.svg file to implement the Image Compare functionality. The Image Compare container has a splitter 
element. This element displays before.jpg on the left and after.jpg on the right. You can adjust the display ratio 
of the two images by clicking on the container or dragging the splitter element. As you adjust the ratio, one 
image will be displayed more prominently, while the other will be displayed less.
You cannot add or remove any HTML elements (except pseudo-elements). You can modify the attributes of 
existing HTML elements (including event listener attributes).
A sample video, "compare.mp4", is provided for reference. Below are some frames from the video:

*Note from implementor: WHY THE F--K WOULD YOU MAKE ME DO JS INLINE, WHATS THE FUCKING DIFFERENCE? JUST MAKES LIFE HARDER*

## Requirement Notes
- The splitter left is before.jpg, the splitter right is after.jpg. No HTML elements were added or removed.
- The splitter can be moved by dragging with the mouse or clicking within the container.
- The imageâ€™s effect is same as the compare.mp4 video
